VEDRAR - Vehicle Event Data Recorder and Review System

VEDRAR is a combination of hardware technologies like proximity sensor, Arduino board and raspberry pi with software tecnologies like MySql database, Machine Learning etc.

The system aims to introduce a device that records the necessary driving data for a period of the drive with the aid of various sensors. The data is used to categorize the driver into a good or bad category of driving. The real-time data from sensors are fed into the system and stored in a memory. This data is processed and analyzed using machine learning algorithm to review the driver’s performance and evaluate his present status of driving skills. This categorization will be provided before the road transportation authority making it a criterion to pass the driving test.

According to WHO stats, traffic injuries caused an estimated 1.25 million deaths every year
i.e., 1 death/25 s. Apart from death, between 20-50 million people suffer from nonfatal injuries
resulting in permanent disability. Almost half of the traffic deaths are among pedestrians, cyclists
and motorcyclists. Adults between 15 and 44 years account for a fifty-nine percentage of global
traffic death. Road traffic injuries cause considerable economic losses to individuals, families, and
nation as a whole. Only 28 countries, representing seven percent of the world’s population have
adequate laws that address all five risk factors (speed, drunk driving, helmets, seat-belts and child
restraints). Without sustained action, road traffic deaths are predicted to be the 7th leading cause
of death by 2020. Ninety percent of the road traffic deaths happen in low- and middle- income
countries. This calls for the need of a low cost efficient safety device.

We are introducing a system similar to Event Data Recorders in aircraft. VEDRAR -
Vehicle Event Data Recorder and Review system acquires various data’s depending on different
driving parameters. The system is mainly committed into two approaches:
1. 1. A data acquisition part
2. 2. A review system.

The system first tracks and records the data of vehicle activities during a drive. Then a
review about the driver is carried out and driving feedback is provided to the driver and required
authorities and finally evaluate and categorize drivers into good or bad. And thus leading to better
drivers and safer roads.
